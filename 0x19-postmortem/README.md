## Postmortem

### Issue Summary
Duration: 1 hour (May 9, 2023, 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM EDT)  
Impact: The web application was down, resulting in a complete outage for all users.  
Root Cause: An unexpected surge in traffic overwhelmed the servers and caused them to crash.

### Timeline
10:00 AM: The issue was detected when users started to report that they were unable to access the web application.  
10:02 AM: The engineering team received an alert from the monitoring system indicating that the web application was down.  
10:05 AM: The team started investigating the issue by checking the server logs and running diagnostic tests to identify the root cause of the problem.  
10:15 AM: The team initially suspected that the issue was related to the application code and started to analyze it to find any bugs or errors.  
10:30 AM: As the issue persisted, the team realized that the servers were unable to handle the sudden increase in traffic.  
10:45 AM: The incident was escalated to senior management as it was determined that the issue required additional resources and attention.  
11:00 AM: The incident was resolved by increasing the server capacity and optimizing the application code.

### Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the issue was an unexpected surge in traffic to the web application. The increase in traffic overwhelmed the servers, causing them to crash and resulting in a complete outage for all users.  
To resolve the issue, the engineering team increased the server capacity to handle the additional traffic and optimized the application code to ensure that it could handle future surges in traffic.

### Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, the following corrective and preventative measures will be implemented:
- Increase server capacity to handle unexpected surges in traffic
- Implement automatic scaling to adjust server capacity based on traffic
- Optimize application code to improve performance and reduce resource usage
- Improve monitoring to detect issues more quickly and accurately
- Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to ensure that the web application can be quickly restored in the event of an outage.  

Overall, the incident served as a reminder of the importance of robust infrastructure and effective monitoring to ensure the continued availability and performance of critical web applications.
